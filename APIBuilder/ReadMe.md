## Build API Call
To use, enter the custom API that you'd like to use, along with the API version, the type of method (GET,PUT,POST,DELETE) <br>
Once you've built your API call, select Build API Command <br>
If built successfully, you will receive a message stating 'API is now built!' <br>

## Save API Call
You may also save this API call to file to easily reference and re-use in MNCT later by selecting Save API Call. <br>
Once selected, you will be prompted to save into a file directory as a .txt file. <br>

## Import API Call
To Import, select Import API call. Navigate to the API call (Example reference API call files have been stored under the GET and PUT folders in this project) <br>
Once imported, the variables and objects in the API builder will update with the new information. <br>
After importing, select Build API Command to use this in MNCT. <br>

## Import Data
The Import Data is used for API data that is utilized in POST or PUT operations. Simply import the JSON data as a .txt file and select it when the browse directory import data appears. (If using PUT or POST, it requires Importing data before the API Command can be successfully built.)
